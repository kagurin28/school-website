# Welcome to my school website's github repo!
This is a school project to make a webiste showing off New Town High School. This is similar to [actualquak](https://github.com/actualquak/School-View)'s and [frlegg](https://github.com/frlegg/School-View)'s websites but more like an actual website than a powerpoint presentation. This website uses **PHP**, the forbidden language (according to some people).

I have absolutely no idea how you would run this btw. This is simply the server files for the website. However, I did put the apache2 site config file in as serverConf.conf, so you may be able to run it somehow.

## Features
* Home page
* Streetview
* Map for streetview
* About pages (in development)
### Planned features
* Improve streetview map
* Videos

## About...
### The Streetview
I was expecting this to take ages buy HOLY SHIT, this probably took up like 90%+ of the total time.
It is powered by [Pannellum](https://pannellum.org/), an open-source panorama displayer that is actually really good!
### PHP
Yes, I used PHP, what is you guys' problem with it? It's not even that bad, and I'd prefer it over Javascript any day!
