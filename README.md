# Welcome to my school website's github repo!
This is a school project to make a webiste showing off New Town High School. This is similar to [actualquak](https://github.com/actualquak/School-View)'s website but more like an actual website than a powerpoint presentation. (although I think actualquak is working on a Ruby on Rails rewrite, frlegg is still trying to do something with the old one though) This website uses **PHP**, the forbidden language (according to some people). Please don't DDoS, but the ip is [115.70.216.137](http://115.70.216.137).

I have absolutely no idea how you would run this btw. This is simply the server files for the website. However, I did put the apache2 site config file in as serverConf.conf, so you may be able to run it somehow.


## Features
* Streetview
* Map for streetview
* About pages (in development)

* Improve file structure
* Holy dark mode (yes I couldn't resist adding a button)

## About...
### The Streetview
The streetview is probably the main feature of the website, and what it is kind of made for.
It is powered by [Pannellum](https://pannellum.org/), an open-source panorama displayer that is actually really good!
### PHP
Yes, I used PHP, what is you guys' problem with it? It's not even that bad, and I'd prefer it over Javascript any day!
### Meme videos
The meme videos are stored in a mysql table and not even I know what horrors are on there. Try clicking on "Bonus Content".
