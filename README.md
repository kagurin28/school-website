# Welcome to my school website's github repo!
This is a school project to make a webiste showing off New Town High School. This is similar to [actualquak](https://github.com/actualquak/School-View)'s one but more like an actual website than a powerpoint presentation. This website uses **PHP**, the forbidden language (according to Stanley and Franklin).
