# Welcome to my school website's github repo!
This is a school project to make a webiste showing off New Town High School. This is similar to [actualquak](https://github.com/actualquak/School-View)'s one but more like an actual website than a powerpoint presentation. This website uses **PHP**, the forbidden language (according to Stanley and Franklin).

**PLESE NOTE:** As I have not set up a server yet (*which I really, really need to do because I have less that a week left*), you will need to download php and then run the following command:
```
/path/to/php/php.exe -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t /path/to/folder/school-website
```
and then go to 127.0.0.1:8000 on a web browser to see the website.

## Features
* Home page
* Streetview (in development)
* About pages (in development)
### Planned features
* Map for streetview
* **GET AN ACTUAL FUCKING SERVER, YOU IDIOT**
