# Welcome to my school website's github repo!
This is a school project to make a webiste showing off New Town High School. This is similar to [actualquak](https://github.com/actualquak/School-View)'s and [frlegg](https://github.com/frlegg/School-View)'s websites but more like an actual website than a powerpoint presentation. This website uses **PHP**, the forbidden language (according to some people).

**PLESE NOTE:** As I have not set up a server yet, you will need to download php and then run the following command:
```
/path/to/php/php.exe -S 127.0.0.1:80 -t /path/to/folder/school-website
```
and then go to 127.0.0.1:80 on a web browser to see the website.

## Features
* Home page
* Streetview
* Map for streetview
* About pages (in development)
### Planned features
* Improve streetview map
* Videos
* Server (See note below)

## About...
### The Streetview
I was expecting this to take ages buy HOLY SHIT, this probably took up like 90%+ of the total time.
It is powered by [Pannellum](https://pannellum.org/), an open-source panorama displayer that is actually really good!
### PHP
Yes, I used PHP, what is you guys' problem with it? It's not even that bad, and I'd prefer it over Javascript any day!
## Note on server
I am planning on hosting this website on a Raspberry Pi 3, running Raspbian with Apache. I could do this much easier, **if only the education proxy was not so fucking trash** (think ssh and sftp. Also, **DID I EVER MENTION GIT?**). I am also planning on buying a domain (no, Stanley, I am not going to say which one for obvious reasons).
